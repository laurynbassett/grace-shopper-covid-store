# Covid Store

_Ecommerce Website_

Covid Store is a fully functional ecommerce website built over 9 days with two teammates at Fullstack Academy. Inspired by the global pandemic, we decided to sell essential covid supplies like gloves, masks, hand sanitizer, and toilet paper.

## Tech Stack

The website was built with React and Redux on the front-end, and Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL on the back-end.

We also used Stripe for payment configuration and Algolia Search API for searching store products.

For styling our React components we used Material-UI, Styled Icons, and Styled Compnents.
